[![Download Releases](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-Releases-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://github.com/jdj3jdj/BadStick/releases)

BadStick is an Xbox 360 auto exploit setup tool. It helps you prepare a USB stick, inject required files, and run the exploit on an Xbox 360 console. This guide walks you through downloading the app from the Releases page and using it step by step. No programming skills required.

## üöÄ What BadStick Does
- Prepare a USB stick with the correct file layout for common Xbox 360 exploits.
- Copy exploit files and payloads to the USB.
- Verify file integrity and layout before you plug the USB into your console.
- Provide a simple interface for the main tasks needed to run the exploit.

## ‚úÖ System Requirements (Typical)
- Windows 10 or later, or macOS 10.14 or later. A Windows build is most common.
- 1 GB free disk space.
- A USB flash drive (4 GB or larger).
- An Xbox 360 console that accepts USB-based exploits.
- A standard USB port on your PC.

If you use a different OS, use the Windows build under Releases via a compatible machine or a virtual machine.

## üß≠ Quick Start ‚Äî Prepare Your USB
Follow these steps to prepare the USB stick and run the exploit.

1. Back up files on the USB drive. The process will erase data.
2. Insert the USB drive into your PC.
3. Open BadStick.
4. Choose the target USB drive from the list inside the app.
5. Pick the exploit type. If you do not know, choose the suggested default or "Auto-detect".
6. Select the payload file. If you do not have a payload, BadStick includes a default option or points to recommended payloads.
7. Click "Prepare USB" or "Write". Wait until the app reports success.
8. Remove the USB safely from your PC.

Now the USB is ready for the console.

## üîå How to Use on Your Xbox 360
1. Turn off the console.
2. Insert the USB stick into a USB port on the console.
3. Power on the console and navigate to the section that triggers the exploit (this varies by exploit type; the app shows the target).
4. Follow on-screen prompts on the console to run the exploit.
5. If the exploit runs, you may see a short console response or app action. The console will proceed according to the exploit flow.

Do not unplug the USB while the console is processing files.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Common Features
- USB format and layout for exploit compatibility.
- Payload selection and verification.
- File integrity checks.
- Device detection for common USB models.
- Logs and status updates to track each step.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
If something does not work, try these items in order.

1. The app does not detect the USB:
   - Reinsert the USB in a different port.
   - Use a different USB stick.
   - Close other programs that might access the drive.
2. The app fails to write files:
   - Check that the USB is not write-protected.
   - Reformat the USB using the app's format option or via your OS (FAT32 recommended).
3. The console does not run the exploit:
   - Confirm you used the correct exploit type for your console model and dashboard version.
   - Ensure the payload you selected matches the exploit.
   - Try a different USB port on the console.
4. Installer will not run (Windows):
   - Right-click the installer and choose "Run as administrator".
   - Temporarily disable antivirus if it blocks the installer. Re-enable it after installing.
5. App crashes or shows errors:
   - Re-download the latest release from the Releases page and reinstall.
   - Check the app log. The log folder appears in the app settings.

If logs do not help, include the log file when you contact support.
